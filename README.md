# hexapod vision test

Most of this is yet another experimental Convolutional neural network in C++ for ARM CPU  
or yaexnnic++fac for short.  

You can test the code and benchmark it with:  
`./compile-all.sh && ./benchmark.sh`  
Or simply compile with the optimal flags with:  
`./compile.sh`  

Have fun.
