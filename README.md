# hexapod vision test

Most of this is yet another experimental Convolutional neural network in C++ for ARM CPU__
or yaexnnic++fac for short.____

You can test the code and benchmark it with:__
`./compile-all.sh && ./benchmark.sh`

Or simply compile with the optimal flags with:__
`./compile.sh`____


Have fun.
